# Emulating an IoT Network Layer
The task is to emulate an IoT network layer protocol that could be used for routing the sensor readings collected at different locations of a city. With this said, parking lots in the city of Pretoria, Gauteng, with a radius of 100 kilometers (km) was analyzed. The coordinate of the city is where latitude is; -25.748486736755563 and longitude is; 28.23225086416299. Data was gathered of parking lots across the city using their latitude and longitude, respectively with a radius of 100 km, alongside the assistance of Radio Mobile and Instant Contiki Ubuntu 2.7 Cooja Simulator. Figure 1 displays Cooja Simulator that was used to emulate an IoT network based on parking lots in Pretoria.
